# subtraction-of-different-dark-current
Professionally I a, involved in a lot of spectroscopical measurements. Therefore, a lot of images are accumulated. 
Here I present a small script, how to check if the camera records diferent dark current level under different measurement conditions. 
Basically how many counts are detected by camera ccd chip under different ambient conditions. 
Firstly, I have measured some LED and took an image of this source. 
Secondly, I took Dark Current (DC) Image, when the camera was covered with cup and Light switched off, without cup with Light switched off, with cup and Light switched on. 
Thirdly, I have plotted all images, substracted from light source image all DC images and compared noise level. 
If you want to discuss it in details, feel free to contact me.
